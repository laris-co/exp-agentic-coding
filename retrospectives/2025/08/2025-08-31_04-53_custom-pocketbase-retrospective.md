**Start Time**: ~11:00 GMT+7 (~04:00 UTC)
**End Time**: 11:53 GMT+7 (04:53 UTC)
**Duration**: ~53 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Implementing custom PocketBase Go application with extended routes
**Session Type**: Feature Development
**Current Issue**: #6
**Last PR**: #7
**Export**: retrospectives/exports/session_2025-08-31_04-53.md

## Session Summary
Successfully transformed PocketBase from a standalone executable into a customizable Go framework application by creating a custom Go app with a `/hello` endpoint. Implemented GitHub flow with proper branching, testing, and PR creation. Also demonstrated live reload workflow when user made changes.

## Timeline
- 11:00 - Started session, analyzed pocketbase-source directory and issue #5
- 11:05 - Created comprehensive implementation plan as issue #6
- 11:10 - User requested simpler version, revised issue to minimal implementation
- 11:15 - Started implementation with GitHub flow (feat/custom-pocketbase-hello branch)
- 11:20 - Created custom-pb directory, initialized Go module, wrote main.go
- 11:25 - Built and tested application successfully (33MB binary)
- 11:30 - Created .gitignore, README, committed changes
- 11:35 - Pushed branch and created PR #7 with detailed instructions
- 11:40 - User requested server run instructions, updated PR
- 11:45 - Started server on port 8091 for user testing
- 11:48 - User modified main.go, demonstrated rebuild/restart workflow
- 11:50 - Committed user's changes, pushed to PR
- 11:53 - Created retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
.gitignore
custom-pb/.gitignore
custom-pb/README.md
custom-pb/go.mod
custom-pb/go.sum
custom-pb/main.go
```

### Key Code Changes
- Created custom-pb module: Simple 20-line Go application using PocketBase as framework
- main.go: Implemented custom `/hello` route using OnServe().BindFunc()
- Added comprehensive .gitignore for Go projects
- Created README with clear usage instructions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Separate Directory Approach**: Created custom-pb/ instead of modifying original to maintain clean separation
- **Minimal Implementation**: Focused on simplest possible working example (20 lines of code)
- **Port Strategy**: Used port 8091 to avoid conflicts with existing PocketBase on 8090
- **Framework Pattern**: Used PocketBase's hook system for extensibility

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: This section provides crucial context for future sessions**

Starting this session, I had comprehensive context from analyzing the pocketbase-source directory - understanding it was v0.29.3 with Go backend, Svelte UI, and SQLite. When creating the initial implementation plan, I went quite detailed with 4 phases and extensive documentation. The user's immediate feedback "i want a very simple version please revise the issue" was a clear signal to drastically simplify.

The pivot to minimal implementation was enlightening - from a comprehensive plan to just 4 steps and 20 lines of code. This really drove home the "minimum viable" principle. The actual implementation went smoothly using the GitHub flow pattern.

An interesting moment came when testing - port 8090 was already in use by the original PocketBase, so I switched to 8091. This kind of practical detail often gets overlooked in planning but is crucial in real implementation.

When the user modified main.go to add "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx" to the response, I had to explain the rebuild process since Go is compiled. This teaching moment about compiled vs interpreted languages and different reload strategies was valuable.

The user's workflow preference became clear: they want clean GitHub flow with PRs but maintain control over merging. They also prefer hands-on testing - "run for me and give me link" shows they want to see things working immediately.

## What Went Well
- **Quick simplification**: Responded immediately to user's request for simpler approach
- **Clean implementation**: 20-line solution that fully demonstrates the concept
- **Proper GitHub flow**: Branch, commit, push, PR without any issues
- **Live demonstration**: Successfully ran server for user to test
- **Rebuild workflow**: Clearly explained how to reload Go applications after changes

## What Could Improve
- **Initial over-engineering**: First plan was too comprehensive for user's needs
- **Port conflict handling**: Could have anticipated 8090 being in use
- **Automatic reload**: Could have suggested air or similar tool from the start

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Port 8090 already in use by original PocketBase
  **Resolution**: Used port 8091 instead
- **Blocker**: User's changes needed rebuild (compiled language)
  **Resolution**: Killed process, rebuilt binary, restarted server

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: This section ensures continuous improvement**

The user's feedback style is refreshingly direct - "i want a very simple version" and "now gogogo" are clear action signals. No ambiguity, no lengthy discussions. This communication style is actually ideal for rapid development.

The initial over-detailed plan was my mistake - I should have started with the simplest possible approach and expanded if needed. The user clearly values action over planning, implementation over documentation.

I noticed the user tests everything immediately - they modified the code themselves to see the reload process work. This hands-on approach suggests they're learning by doing, not just delegating tasks.

The "now rrr" at the end shows they've internalized the workflow shortcuts, which is satisfying to see. The session felt productive despite my initial misstep with complexity.

One thing that surprised me: the user made their own code changes directly while I was running. This shows trust in the collaborative process and comfort with the development environment.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Start with absolute minimum viable implementation, expand only if requested
- **Pattern**: Users who say "gogogo" want immediate action, not detailed planning
- **Discovery**: Port conflicts are common in local development - always have backup ports ready
- **Pattern**: For compiled languages, always explain the rebuild process upfront
- **Mistake**: Over-engineering initial solutions - simplicity should be the default

## Next Steps
- [ ] User to review and merge PR #7 when ready
- [ ] Potential Phase 2: Add more custom routes if needed
- [ ] Consider adding air for auto-reload in development
- [ ] Explore adding custom business logic with database access
